I spent a year proving my value to a company that barely noticed.

Every demo I built for management was met with apathy. Every system I prototyped was answered with "just finish your tasks." Every architectural suggestion I made was politely ignored.

I had done everything right. Or.. so I thought.  
  

Four years into my role at a growing startup, I made a decision: this was my year to level up. I would become the engineer they *couldn't* ignore.

I worked nights. I dove deep into our tech stack. I researched solutions to pain points nobody had asked me to solve. I built things. I prepared presentations. I showed up with ideas.

The timing felt perfect—the engineering department was restructuring, and I saw my opening. A senior role. Cross-functional work. The kind of position where I could finally have real impact.

If you've ever struggled with imposter syndrome, you know the math: *if I just work hard enough, eventually I'll deserve to be here.* I wasn't going to let my dreams stay dreams (thanks Shia).

The problem wasn't the imposter syndrome. It wasn't the dedication.

It was believing my company would care.

Here's what I didn't understand: to my coworkers, I was already categorized. That's just how human brains work—we sort people into boxes because it's efficient. "Sean? He's the [whatever] guy." Breaking out of that box doesn't just require being better. It requires being *so much* better that people are forced to update their mental model. Most never will.

And even when you do bring something genuinely valuable? Companies resist change. Every improvement carries technical debt. Every new idea means someone has to maintain it. Seniors will scrutinize your suggestions not because they're bad, but because *any* change creates work.

So there I was: burned out, overlooked, and sitting with side projects that my company had politely declined to acknowledge.

Then it hit me—the most important realization of my entire career:

**No one cares about your work.**

Not the late nights. Not the extra research. Not the demos you spent weekends perfecting.

The only people who remember you worked late are your family, your friends, your dog, and yourself. *They're* the ones paying the price for your "dedication."

Here's the twist: this isn't depressing. It's *liberating*.

When you stop working for recognition that might never come, you get something better—freedom to work on what actually excites you.

Want to learn about AI and RAG pipelines? Build that project utilizing those technologies, but build it because *you* want to understand the technology. Add it to your portfolio. Present it to your company if you want, but drop the expectation that they'll adopt it or reward you for the extra hours.

The freedom extends beyond work, too. Your colleagues won't remember the system you implemented last quarter. But your friends will remember the weekend trip. Your kids will remember you being present. *You'll* remember having a life outside your IDE.

## What I'm Doing Differently Now

I work my hours. I do good work during those hours. And then I close the laptop.

When I build things outside of work now, I build them for *me*—because I'm genuinely curious, because it's fun, because it goes in my portfolio and follows me wherever I go. Not because I'm hoping someone at my company will finally notice.

This industry changes constantly. The only constant is you. Invest in yourself. Build things you enjoy. And go live your life.

The company will survive. I promise.

Here's a great video by a great person that inspired this blog post:
